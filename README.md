## Objective:

The objective of My study is to
1) Understand all the desired variables 
2) explore the relationships between various demographic characteristics(age, gender, dietary preference, blood group, family type)  and 5 scoring parameters. 
ie Finding Answers to the questions as
i) How does dietary preference influence the scoring parameters; People eating veg or nonveg have more self control ie managing one’s emotion.Understanding these emotional deficiencies can provide a means to subsequently improve the quality of consumption decisions.So.. should you be vegetarian or a nonvegetarian?!!!  
ii) How does family type influence the Emotional Parameters?
iii) Blood group wise which blood group is more stable ie tends to 36 score in all 5 parameters does it affect emotional intelligence
iv) Which age group has more EI 
v) Gender wise behaviour of all the parameters
